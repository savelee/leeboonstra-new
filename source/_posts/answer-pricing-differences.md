title: When should I use Dialogflow Essentials vs. Dialogflow CX?
description: When you are a freelancer, start-up, or small business, when you are building a single chat or voice bot, for example, for the Google Assistant or building an FAQ bot, Dialogflow Essentials might be a better choice for you. This tool is often chosen for its simplicity. When you are an enterprise customer building a large & complex chatbot platform or contact center customer experience, when data regionalization is crucial for you (for example because of GDPR) or your conversation requires lots of turn-taking turns and dialogue branches, Dialogflow CX is the tool to use. This tool addresses the need for businesses to build more complex chat & contact center voice bots.
