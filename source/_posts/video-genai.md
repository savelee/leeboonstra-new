A non-technical explanation of the inner workings of Generative AI
Everyone is talking about it: Generative AI and Large Language Models. To really understand what you can do with them, how to refine them for your own use, but also what the dangers are, it helps to understand how these models work.

LLMs are trained on massive datasets of text and code, and can generate text, translate languages, write different kinds of creative content, and answer your questions in an informative way.

In this talk, Lee Boonstra, Software Engineer Tech Lead and advocate will provide a beginner’s guide to LLMs and generative AI technology. She explains what these technologies are, how they work, and what they can be used for. Let’s be honest and also discuss the potential risks and benefits of these technologies, and how we can ensure that they are used for good and not for harm.
