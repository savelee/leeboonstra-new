Let's create a conversation between you and Google that helps you to retrieve information about what's on TV.

At Google we provide assistance to our products for years. With the Google Assistant we are helping users through the day. This can be at home via a voice activated speaker like Google Nest or on the way through phones, tablets, watches or cars via the Google Assistant. 

You donâ€™t need to be a developer. With Dialogflow, it is possible to create natural conversations for chatbots and voice activated speakers. In this session, you will learn about machine learning and how to create custom conversation agents with Dialogflow.

<i>Basic JavaScript knowledge is required.</i>

<i>Bring your laptop, a headset, or a proper microphone and headphones, in case you want to test the Google Assistant at the conference.</i>
