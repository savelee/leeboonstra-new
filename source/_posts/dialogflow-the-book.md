After I wrote my first book (Hands-on Sencha Touch 2 — O’Reilly), people always asked me if I would ever write another book. Especially, when I started to get expertise in conversational AI. I never said ‘never’, but I knew it would probably eat a lot of my time. Fast forward to February 2020, the whole world looked a lot different, and due to COVID-19, I had to cancel all my trips. Suddenly, I had a lot of extra time, plans for a book about chatbots became real! So I started to write...

There aren’t that many books about conversational AI for technical practitioners on the market, and I wanted to write this especially for enterprise users. Thus UX designers/linguists, web/conversational bot engineers, chatbot architects but also back-end developers, project managers and business decision makers that are working on complex conversational projects. Far beyond the ‘hello world examples’, as those are the real-world use cases that I see in my day to day life, while working for Google as a developer advocate and applied AI engineer focussing on Conversational AI.

Today, I am excited to announce with you that my book:  

**[The Definitive Guide to Conversational AI With Dialogflow and Google Cloud ](https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-Conversational-Dialogflow-Google/dp/1484270134/)** _(Build Advanced Enterprise Chatbots, Voice, and Telephony Agents on Google Cloud)_ has been released by [Apress](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484270134) / [Springer](https://www.springer.com/gp/book/9781484270134) this week! 

ISBN 978–1–4842–7014–1 & ISBN 978–1–4842–7013–4

It's a book that covers all the conversational AI technology at Google Cloud & Google. Like, **Dialogflow Essentials**, **Dialogflow CX**, **Google Assistant** and **Contact Center AI**. But it also covers Google Cloud technology such as BigQuery for advanced Chatbot analytics, how to build your own integration channels with **Cloud Run**, **GKE**, **Compute Engine** or **Cloud Functions**. And it covers other Machine Learning APIs such **Natural Language Processing**.

While reading this book, readers will learn the following:

*   What's Dialogflow, Dialogflow Essentials, Dialogflow CX, and how machine learning is used
*   How to create Dialogflow projects for individuals and enterprise usage
*   Learn Dialogflow Essentials Concepts like Intents, Entities, Custom Entities, System Entities, Composites and how to track context
*   How to build bots quickly using prebuilt agents, small talk modules, and FAQ knowledge bases
*   How Dialogflow can give an out of the box agent review
*   How to deploy text conversational UIs for web & social media channels
*   How to build voice agents for voice assistants (Google Assistant) & phone gateways/contact centers with Contact Center AI
*   How to build multilingual chatbots
*   Learn how to orchestrate many (sub) chatbots to build a bigger conversational platform
*   How to use Chatbot analytics and how to test the quality of your Dialogflow agent (machine learning model)
*   Learn how Dialogflow CX fits in, what’s different in Dialogflow CX and new Dialogflow CX concepts

These topics are more targeted to developers & engineers and contain more advanced use cases:

*   Learn how to create fulfillment to connect to a web service in various ways
*   How to run back-end code from a local/development machine
*   How to secure your chatbots
*   How to integrate your chatbots in a website (Angular) or native mobile (Flutter) app by creating your own custom integrations
*   How to create an omnichannel bot platform architecture
*   How to create rich responses in custom integrations
*   How to stream your voice UIs in IoT voice applications
*   Using BigQuery for advanced chatbot analytics

It contains tips and tricks and code examples to work on complex use-cases. It's a book that I often use to quickly look up things like: _"Oh, how would I build a Google Assistant action with Dialogflow CX again?"_, _"How can I test the underlying bot model to get the best performance?"_, _"How does mTLS work to secure my bot fulfillments?"_. With other words, it's a book that I wrote for the conversational chatbot & voice community!

As a few of you might know, I wrote this book during my pregnancy, when the world went into lock down. To come full circle, I picked a non profit organization to donate all my book royalties to, which is the [“Meer dan Gewenst“](https://www.meerdangewenst.nl/about-mdg/), foundation in the Netherlands, an NGO that helps the LGBTQ+ community who have a wish to become parents. They do this by raising awareness (contacts with media, politicians and businesses), education and connections. As an LGBTQ+ parent myself, this charity is close to my heart, as I think having a wish to become a parent should be possible for everyone.

You can find my book as a paperback and ebook on [Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-Conversational-Dialogflow-Google/dp/1484270134/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=Definitive+Guide+to+Conversational+AI&qid=1624873031&sr=8-1&asin=B097XX9B3R&revisionId=&format=2&depth=1). 

_Feel free to connect with me on social media if you have comments or feedback about the book. Do you like my work? I would love to receive book reviews. As a developer advocate, I enjoy speaking about anything related to chat and voice bot technology. I am available for speaking engagements._
