It gives businesses insights into the topics that are being discussed by their end-users.  You can monitor how those conversations have been handled by the service agent through transcripts, caller sentiment detection, silence detection, entity identification, and topic modeling.

CCAI Insights is a core piece of the Google Contact Center AI product suite that enables Contact Center management to make data driven business decisions and improve customer experience.
