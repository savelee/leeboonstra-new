When people think of chatbots, they often think of that little support popup on a website, not understanding what you actually mean. It shouldn't be like that. With AI powered chatbots, it doesn't matter how you say or spell your questions, it will understand you. There are actually many types of chatbots; bots in social media, bots in advertising and bots specialized in understanding voice. The chatbots which live in smart speakers & assistant AI's and the chatbots running in phone reservation systems and contact centers!
