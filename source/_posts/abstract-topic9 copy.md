It appears that most organizations employing conversational platforms, like chatbots and voicebots, rarely use analytics. This is a missed opportunity since a well-designed and smart use of analytics can be crucial to improving the customer experience. 

In this session Lee Boonstra, Developer Advocate for Conversational AI @ Google, and author of the book: [The Definitive Guide to Conversational AI with Dialogflow & Google Cloud](https://www.apress.com/gp/book/9781484270134) will guide you through all the different kinds of data you can consider monitoring in your conversational analytics. 

You will learn how to collect data from your voice and chatbots, and more importantly: how to translate all of your collected data into actual actions to improve conversational implementations.
