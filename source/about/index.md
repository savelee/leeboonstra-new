Software Engineer & Advocate for the <a href="https://blog.google/products/google-cloud/octo-google-clouds-two-way-innovation-street/">Office of the CTO</a>

<b>Google</b>

[Lee Boonstra](https://plus.google.com/117712452932146916020) is a software engineer for the Cloud office of the CTO at Google.

The Office of the CTO (OCTO) is a diverse team of highly experienced engineers and technologists, working on behalf of the Cloud CEO, whose mission is to foster market-disrupting collaborative innovation between Google and the world's most ambitious organizations. The customers we engage have hard technical problems and strong brand identities. In 2022, the OCTO team is starting an incubation/acceleration program (called the "Applied Innovation Factory") to test the boundaries on ideas that could cause strategic shifts in industry and GCP's business. We seek impact in everything from futuristic computing issues to AI and Voice technology.

Lee has been at Google since 2017. She is a conversational AI expert and has helped many businesses develop AI-powered chatbots and voice assistants at an enterprise scale. They are building intelligent AI, contact center platforms on the Google Cloud Platform using our Conversational AI tools.

Lee has worn different hats in the past 20 years. She began her career as an engineer developing websites and apps for famous brands and large enterprises such as ING Bank, KLM, and Heineken. She worked for Sencha Inc. as a lead technical trainer and curriculum creator before moving to Google as a sales engineer, developer advocate and software engineer.

Lee is also a published author. She wrote the book [The Definitive Guide to Conversational AI with Dialogflow & Google Cloud](https://www.amazon.com/Definitive-Guide-Conversational-Dialogflow-Google/dp/1484270134/ref=asc_df_1484270134/) for Apress and [Hands-On Sencha Touch 2](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Sencha-Touch-Real-World-Approach/dp/144936652X/ref=sr_1_1) for O'Reilly.

Besides writing and her work at Google, she is an active member of the [DDMA Voice Committee](https://ddma.nl/commissies/voice/) in the Netherlands. This task force aims to increase the belief in the ‘voice channel’ by showing brands and publishers its opportunities for marketing, sales, and service and, therefore, to give it a permanent place in the digital transformation.

With so many roles, there is one title that she is the proudest of: being the mother of her toddler; Rebel.
