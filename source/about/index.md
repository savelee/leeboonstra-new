## What is a Developer Advocate?

**TL;DR: A developer advocate is a developer’s best friend!**

A Developer Advocate's role is to act as a bridge between the engineering team and the developer community. Their job is to give feedback to both parties, equally, in both ways. 

Also, a Developer Advocate is an engineer who has good communication and community-building skills.  The responsibilities of the role typically are some or all of the following: public speaking, writing public open source code, writing articles and creating (video) content.

With other words; A Developer Advocate is someone who truly advocates for developers, not just a platform.

>“Every presentation needs a live demo! I'm an engineer and I love to show what I have built!”

## Speaking & Article Topics

I love technology, especially Chatbots, Customer Care & Web, and I love writing and speaking about it!

Topics include: **Dialogflow, Chatbots, Customer Care, The Future of the Contact Center (CCAI), Machine Learning for Developers, Diversity, LGBTQ+, Women in Tech, AI for Financials**

> “I love <strong>creating</strong>, instead of just consuming technology.”

Beside technology I love (alternative) music, concerts and I’m a videogames addict.
