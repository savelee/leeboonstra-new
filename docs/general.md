This repository contains the source code for a personal blog or website. Based on the file structure, it appears to be a static site built with the [Hexo](https://hexo.io/) framework.

The project uses Markdown for content creation, and its technology stack likely includes Node.js for running Hexo and managing dependencies. The site is configured for deployment on Firebase, as indicated by the `firebase.json` file. The `.github/workflows` directory suggests automated CI/CD processes for deployment and maintenance.
