# Project: savelee/leeboonstra-new

This repository contains the source code for a personal blog, built with the Hexo static site generator.

The project is configured for Node.js and utilizes various frontend technologies for asset management and optimization. It appears to be a standard Hexo blog structure with posts, drafts, and themes. The inclusion of `firebase.json` and `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml` suggests it is automatically deployed to Firebase Hosting via GitHub Actions. The site also includes PWA features, indicated by the presence of a serviceworker and Workbox configuration.
