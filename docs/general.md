This repository contains the source code for a personal blog built with the Hexo framework. It appears to be a Node.js project that uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and deployment to Firebase hosting. The styling is likely handled by SASS. The content is written in Markdown and organized into posts, pages, and drafts within the `source` directory.
