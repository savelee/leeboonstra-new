# Project: savelee/leeboonstra-new

This repository contains a personal blog built with the Hexo static site generator.

The project uses Node.js and Markdown for content creation. It appears to be configured for automated builds and deployment via GitHub Actions and Firebase hosting. The presence of configuration files like `_config.yml` and theme/scaffold directories are characteristic of a Hexo project.
