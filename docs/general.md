This repository contains the source code for a personal blog website. Based on the file structure, it appears to be built with the Hexo static site generator.

The technology stack includes:
- **Hexo** for site generation
- **Node.js** for tooling and dependencies
- **Markdown** for content
- **Firebase** for hosting

The site is configured with PWA features using Workbox and includes scripts for asset management and deployment. The content is organized in the `source/` directory, with blog posts located in `source/_posts/`.
