# Project: savelee/leeboonstra-new

This repository contains a personal blog built with the Hexo static site generator. The project uses Node.js and processes Markdown files from the `source/` directory to generate HTML content.

Key files like `_config.yml`, `package.json`, and theme configurations indicate its purpose as a website. The presence of `.github/workflows` suggests automated deployment workflows, possibly to Firebase Hosting as hinted by `firebase.json`. The content is organized into posts, pages, and drafts, typical of a blogging platform.
