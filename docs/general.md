# Project: savelee/leeboonstra-new

This repository contains a personal blog built with the Hexo static site generator. Based on the file structure (`_config.yml`, `scaffolds/`, `source/_posts`), it serves as a platform for publishing articles and posts.

The technology stack includes Hexo, Markdown for content creation, and likely Node.js for dependency management. The project is configured for automated deployment to Firebase Hosting via GitHub Actions, as indicated by `firebase.json` and `.github/workflows/firebase-deploy.yml`.
