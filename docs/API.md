I will analyze the codebase for API endpoints and generate comprehensive Markdown documentation. First, I'll search for API definitions by looking for common filenames like `server.js` or `routes.js`, and for directories such as `api/` or `controllers/`. If that doesn't yield results, I'll perform a broader search for HTTP handling keywords like `express` or `app.get` to locate any routing logic. I'll begin by listing the current files to get my bearings.I see it's a static site. No server-side API files are apparent. I'll check for client-side API calls or serverless functions. I'm now searching the entire project for keywords like `fetch`, `axios`, `XMLHttpRequest`, `API`, and `endpoint` to find any relevant code.
